** Shell basics
*** Basic commands
**** Combining commands
*** The shell environment
**** The =PATH= environment variable
**** Saving modifications
     Modifications can be saved across terminal/console sessions by modifying the either =~/.bashrc= or =~/.bash-profile=. The difference between these two files is that =~/.bashrc= is read on every new terminal session (e.g. when opening a new prompt window/tab), whereas =~/.bash-profile= is only read when you first log in to the terminal.

     Most of the time you want to put your modifications in =~/.bashrc=.

     Files like these which are used to modify the shell environment or configure a program usually begin with a =.= (dot) and are commonly referred to as /dotfiles/.
